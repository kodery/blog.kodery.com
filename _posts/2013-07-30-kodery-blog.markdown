Hey! Tom here.

It's exciting times for Kodery. At 12devs of Summer 2013 we launched the alpha to over 80 designers and developer. It was really tight squeeze â€“ wrote the code to let them in on the train and in Leicester Square before hand! We're hard at work fixing bugs and building features, but we also intend to document, right here, almost everything we think and build to do with Kodery over the next weeks and months until we launch and on into the future...

Stay tuned!
