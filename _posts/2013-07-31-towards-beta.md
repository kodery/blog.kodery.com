With the alpha underway we've started thinking about features we want to see in the beta, including a whole load of front and back end improvements, UI for permissions and the usual bug fixes.

We've got our eyes on beta at the beginning of September, and the plan is to start bringing our first paying customers on board as we hit beta. We'll probably reveal our pricing plan sometime in between now and then.

If you, or your company, would like to be one of the first to pay for Kodery, [email us](mailto:info+towards-beta@kodery.com)! We're looking for freelancers and small to medium sized agencies who are happy to give us lots of feedback, and who like discounts ;)
